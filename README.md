# DQN_Unity_Keras

DQN with Unity and Keras

A simple example of how to use DQN Reinforcement Learning in Unity using Keras. Included are (1) example Python scripts that illustrate single and two-agent DQN training and testing using Keras, and (2) a Unity package with two simple 2D unity games: 
o	Wall Pong: A single agent game similar to pong. Agent moves a paddle to hit a ball against a wall.
o	Pong: A simple example of the classic two-agent Atari game.

The python agent connects to the unity game via a virtual (TCP) socket. To use the examples, you will need the following installed:

1.	Python 2.7 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.	Tensorflow - https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
3.	Keras - https://keras.io
4.	Unity - https://unity3d.com


NOTE 1: the python code has only been tested using Python 2.7, on a Mac-Book Pro. I recommend using a virtual environment.

To run the code:
1.	Run a python training or testing script in terminal 
2.	Launch the corresponding game (either in the Unity editor or as a standalone)
3.	Select AI and Click ‘connect’ in the game 
4.	Watch… and watch… and watch…and eventually a successful agent (training usually takes about 1 to 2 hours).

Keon Kim has a great blog tutorial on DQN using Keras: https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/ 
Some of the DQN code provided here was adapted from this tutorial: 

Recently, Unity released a great toolbox for DQN using Tensorflow:
https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/09/19/introducing-unity-machine-learning-agents/?_ga=2.105619654.410151621.1506438822-872552068.1506438822 ). 
I highly recommend you check this toolbox out. 

Basically, this code is a much simpler version of the Unity toolbox and illustrates how to do (more-or-less) the same thing using Keras. Why Keras? Well, Keras offers a front end to Tensorflow and is much simpler to use if you are new to neural-networks and deep-learning. 

Rather than using image data (as in the original DQN work), the agent is also trained using position and velocity data. Which for most Unity and VR applications is preferable to image data due to the computational cost of deep convolutional network architectures (i.e., no GPU required for these examples).

NOTE 2: I developed the code in early 2017 and should have posted it then…but there is never enough time in the day. Have fun!
